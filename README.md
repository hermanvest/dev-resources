# Dev Resources

This repository contains the resources I have used to get up to speed when working on different projects. I recommend that you follow the order of topics as outlined below. You will be able to find relevant resources in the directories. 

## 0. Primer/intro

Challenges of being a developer and how to handle some of them. Mostly about mindset.

1. You don't know what challenges you will face. Just start developing and discover them later. It is better to develop fast and discover fast than trying to plan and not do anything
2. 

## 1. JAVA OCP Developer books

Being very proficient in Java is great...

Read the book in its entirety and do all the tasks. 

### (OPTIONAL) 1.1 Kotlin mini course

It is one of two languages you are likely to be working with once in a project. Great to have som exposure to it as well.

Builds on the knowledge you have gained in the first module. Transitioning to Kotlin is no big task and much of the syntax is similar.

## 2. Quick intro to modern architecture

This is important as you will start developing the mental framework necessary to build well structured and functioning applications. It will also help you better understand why we do certain things in the following courses and make you better suited for communicating with architects and stakeholders.

DDD, Tactical DDD and strategic DDD.

Loose coupling in practice: what does it mean and how do we achieve it?

## 3. Spring boot

Spring is important because...

You will learn these basic things about Spring.

## 4. CQRS Event sourcing

## 5. Kafka
(Summary from chatGPT) Apache Kafka is a must-learn for new developers because it empowers you to handle real-time data streams efficiently, a crucial skill in today's data-driven world. Its scalable, distributed architecture and advanced stream processing capabilities make it ideal for building robust, high-performance applications. Learning Kafka opens doors to opportunities in top companies and equips you with the tools to manage and process data streams effectively, making you a valuable asset in any tech team.

Introduction to event-driven design (article by [confluent](https://www.confluent.io/blog/journey-to-event-driven-part-1-why-event-first-thinking-changes-everything/))

Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn. As an introduciton, I recommend that you read [this](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying)

The following are steps I took to start learning about Apache Kafka:
1. Check out "Kafka Certified Developer" by "A Cloud Guru" on Pluralsight. Go here to access the playground (formerly Linux academy): [playground](https://help.pluralsight.com/hc/en-us/articles/24564263824404-Hands-on-playground-overview#access) and choose "sign in with pluralsight credentials". You should probably view the tutorial from [here](https://learn.acloud.guru/), as they have updated links to the resources.

2. Now might be the time to do some reading. Check out this free ebook on kafka by Confluent: https://www.confluent.io/resources/ebook/kafka-the-definitive-guide/

3. After that, you might want to check out: [Apache Kafka Deep Dive](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/bf0aeafb-8bc4-4082-bd3a-00972349b6c0/overview)

4. Practice resources: https://quizlet.com/573725773/apache-kafka-ccdak-study-guide-combined-notes-flash-cards/, https://quizlet.com/fr/931742490/ccdak-apache-kafka-flash-cards/ og andre mock exams p√• UDEMY
